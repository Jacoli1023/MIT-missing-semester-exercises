# Lecture 3: [Editors (Vim)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/)

Most of lecture 3's exercises involve trying vim out, customizing it to your liking, and getting used to its keybindings and workflow over an extended period of time. I've been writing all of the exercise solutions using vim and pushing it via `git`.

I've also uploaded my customized vimrc to my public [dotfiles](https://github.com/Jacoli1023/dotfiles) repo. The repo contains other config files which are managed via [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which allows for an easier installation process when setting up a new machine (which is also my solution to a future exercise problem).

I still have more to learn when it comes to being masterfully efficient with vim, but all this in due time.
