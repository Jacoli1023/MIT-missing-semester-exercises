# 2020 MIT Missing Semester exercise solutions
These are my solutions to the exercises from the MIT course [The Missing Semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). The class's aim is to teach students how to gain proficiency with their own tools, and covers topics ranging from shell tools and scripting, to version control, to security and cryptography. While I gain proficiency with my own tools, I will update this page with my solutions and notes, and will use the knowledge I gain here to organize and streamline my self-taught learning career!

I use Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
